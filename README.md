Exact solutions were derived for the mechanical and thermal response of energy piles using sympy to solve the ODE equation governing the equilibrium, and numpy library served to ease the math calculations. A simplified solution was derived based on the equilibrium of the infinitesimal segment for axial displacement of the energy pile, and then extended to axial strain and stress using the kinematic relationship and constitutive law. Matpoltlip was used to draw the mechanical, thermal, and thermo-mechanical response of the given thermal and mechanical loads.
